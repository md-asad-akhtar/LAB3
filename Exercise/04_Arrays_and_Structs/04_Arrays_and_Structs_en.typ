#task[Arrays][
  For this Exercise write your functions into `Exercise1_Arrays/Arrays.cpp`. \ Try out your code as usual in `main.cpp`.  
  You can have a look into `Exercise1_Arrays/Arrays.h`, if you are having problems figuring out your function headers. \
  \ 
  #subtask[
    Given the Array `grades` and its length `amount_of_grades`. Write a function `average` which, given an array `double[]` and the arrays length as `int`, returns the average of the array as `double` value. \ \
    The average of a given array can be calculated with the following formula: \ \
    $ 1/n sum_(k=1)^n a_k    "       " "Example: " (3+2+1)/3 = 2  $ \
  ]
  #subtask[
    Now we want to implement a `contains` function checking if a given number is an element of a given array or not. Since we learned, that we don't want to compare two `double` values with `==` , we are going to write a `compare` function first. \
    #subtask[
      Our `compare` function shall take two `double` values as parameter and return `true`, if the distance between the two numbers is lower than our threshold `0.00001` and otherwise return `false`. \ \
      _For example the numbers 5 and 4.9 are given:_\ 
      $ |5.0 - 4.9| < 0.00001 \ 
        0.1 < 0.00001 \ 
        => "False"
      $ \
    ]
    #subtask[
      Implement the function `contains` which, given an array `double[]`, the arrays length as `int` as well as a `double` target, returns the index containing the target or, if the target can not be found, returns `-1`. Use your `compare` function when comparing two `double` values. \ \ \ \ \
    ]
    #subtask[
      *Bonus-Task:* \ \
      Compare your solution to the function `contains_binary_search`. \
      Do they do the same thing?
      How many memory-cells are checked, before the right one is found? 
      What assumption must be fulfilled, for `contains_binary_search` to work properly? \ \
      _You will also find answers to these questions, when looking up `binary-search` inside of your web-browser._

#task[Structs][
  For this Exercise write your methods into `Exercise2_Structs/Structs.h` Try out your code as usual in `main.cpp`. \ \

  #subtask[
    Write a `Struct` declaration `Pizza` with the `float`-fields `diameter` and `price` simular to the one from the lecture. Inside the `main` function, initialize two Pizzas taking values from your trusted Pizza-Delivery(Or make up values yourself).
  ]
  #subtask[
    Write the method `price_per_cm2`, which returns exactly that as `float`-value.
  ]
  #subtask[
    Write the method `five_euro_get_you_x_cm2`, which is using the `price_per_cm2` method to calculate the amount of cm2 you get for 5â‚¬ and returns that as `float`-value.
  ]
  Test your methods via the `main` function, so see which Pizza you should be ordering more often.
