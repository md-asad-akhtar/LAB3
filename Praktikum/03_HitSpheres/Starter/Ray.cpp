Ray::Ray(vec3 origin, vec3 direction) : _origin(origin), _direction(direction) {}

/* This is the task. Fill in the intersects method. A ray has an origin point and a direction.
 * A sphere has a center point and a radius, a radius_squared (hint), as well as a colour.
 * If the ray hits no object, return a {} (which indicates that there was no intersection).
 * If the ray hits an object, return a intersection.
 * To find out if a ray hits a sphere, you may (and should) use your math skills.
 * An intersection consists of the colour of the object hit by a ray, the surface normal (a unit_vector pointing from
 * the sphere center to the intersection point) as well as a "_t".
 * If you have an intersection, then _t solves the following:
 *  intersection_point = t * direction + origin
